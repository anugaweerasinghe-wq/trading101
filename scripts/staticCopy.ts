Prices shown in the simulator are sourced from public market data and, between refreshes, moved by a small simulation layer so charts behave realistically during practice sessions.",

Most beginners lose money not because they picked the wrong stock but because they sized positions badly, moved a stop, doubled down after a loss, or traded an instrument they did not understand. All of those habits are visible in a practice account, and all of them are cheaper to unlearn there.",
