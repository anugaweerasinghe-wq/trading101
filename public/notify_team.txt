Subject: TradeHQ SEO Remediation Complete — Action Required

Hi Team,

The SEO remediation and GEO optimization for TradeHQ is complete. Here's what changed and what to monitor:

WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Removed all fabricated authority signals (fake ratings, expert badges, unverifiable claims)
- Replaced all "Live Data" / "Real-Time" labels with "Simulated" across meta, schema, and UI
- Removed unauthorized MNQ asset addition
- Removed unverified sameAs social links from structured data
- Added GEOKeySummary JSON-LD for AI Overview readiness on all trade pages
- Updated all 17 seed asset meta titles/descriptions (Variant A active)
- Wrapped trade pages in semantic HTML (<main>, <header>)
- Added standardized educational disclaimer to all trade pages

WHAT TO MONITOR (next 14 days):
1. Google Search Console → Performance → Impressions, Clicks, CTR
2. Google Search Console → Coverage → Indexed pages count
3. Watch for crawl errors in GSC → Coverage → Errors

ROLLBACK TRIGGERS (act immediately if any):
- CTR drops >50% vs baseline on any seed asset for 7+ days
- Indexation ratio drops below 40% for seed assets
- Average position degrades by >10 positions on any seed asset

OWNER ACTIONS NEEDED:
1. Submit sitemap.xml in Google Search Console
2. Request indexing for seed pages (see search_console_instructions.md)
3. Verify @tradinghq Twitter and LinkedIn accounts exist
4. After 7 days, review baseline CTR and consider A/B test with Variant B

All deliverables are in /public:
- change_log.csv, meta_variants.csv, meta_ab_test_plan.txt
- rich_results_validation_log.csv, link_slug_validation_report.csv
- final_qa_report.txt, search_console_instructions.md

Best,
