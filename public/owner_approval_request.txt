OWNER APPROVAL REQUEST — TradeHQ
==================================

The following changes require explicit owner sign-off before implementation:

1. LIVE MARKET DATA API
   Change: Enable real-time price feeds from CoinGecko/Alpha Vantage/Polygon
   Risk: API rate limits, costs, and potential downtime. Pages would show "Live (via Vendor)" instead of "Simulated"
   Required: API keys, budget approval, rate-limit handling strategy
   Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED — awaiting approval

2. SOCIAL ACCOUNT VERIFICATION (sameAs schema)
   Change: Re-add sameAs links to Organization schema for SEO benefit
   Risk: If accounts don't exist, Google may flag structured data as misleading
   Required: Confirm ownership of:
     - https://twitter.com/tradinghq
     - https://linkedin.com/company/tradinghq
     - https://github.com/tradinghq
   Status: REMOVED — awaiting verification

3. NEW ASSET ADDITIONS
   Change: Any new trading assets beyond current 150+ catalog
   Risk: Each new asset creates a new indexed URL; must have content and FAQ support
   Required: Owner approval per asset with content brief
   Status: MNQ was removed (added without approval)

4. PROGRAMMATIC SEO PAGES (Section C of prompt)
   Change: Create 200+ new pages including:
     - /compare/:assetA-vs-:assetB (comparison pages)
     - /glossary/:term (glossary definitions)
     - 50 Sri Lanka-focused long-tail pages
   Risk: New routes violate the "no new slugs without approval" constraint.
         Mass-generated content requires quality review to avoid thin-content penalties.
   Required: Owner approval for new route patterns, content review of 10-page sample
   Estimated effort: 2-3 days implementation + 1 day QA
   Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED — awaiting approval

5. DYNAMIC OG IMAGE ENDPOINT
   Change: Create /api/og?assetId= server endpoint for dynamic OG images
   Risk: Requires edge function deployment; adds server cost
   Required: Owner approval for edge function usage
   Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED — static OG images currently in use
