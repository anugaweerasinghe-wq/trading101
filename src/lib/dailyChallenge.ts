      { label: "Automatically closes your trade at a preset loss level", correct: true, explain: "Stop-losses cap your downside — the #1 risk tool every pro uses." },
      { label: "Guarantees you exit at the exact price you set", correct: false, explain: "Slippage in fast markets means stops can fill worse than the trigger." },
      { label: "Doubles your position when price drops", correct: false, explain: "That's averaging down — the opposite of stop-losses." },

    options: [
      { label: "Oversold — likely bounce", correct: false, explain: "Oversold is RSI <30, not 80." },
      { label: "Overbought — pullback risk rises", correct: true, explain: "RSI >70 signals overbought; >80 is extreme." },
      { label: "Neutral — keep buying", correct: false, explain: "Neutral RSI is around 50." },

      { label: "Use 2% of current equity as this lesson's example risk budget", correct: true, explain: "If 2% is recalculated from remaining equity, 10 consecutive full-risk losses leave about 81.7% of the starting balance — roughly an 18.3% drawdown before other effects." },
      { label: "Always target 2% profit per trade", correct: false, explain: "Profit targets aren't the rule — risk per trade is." },
      { label: "Trade only 2% of the day", correct: false, explain: "Not a real risk concept." },

    id: 4, prompt: "Why do traders watch the VIX?",
    options: [
      { label: "It measures expected S&P 500 volatility (the 'fear gauge')", correct: true, explain: "Rising VIX = market expects bigger moves. Often spikes at lows." },
      { label: "It tracks Bitcoin dominance", correct: false, explain: "That's BTC.D, not VIX." },

      { label: "Real conviction — higher follow-through odds", correct: true, explain: "Volume validates price — low-volume breakouts often fake out." },
      { label: "A trap — short immediately", correct: false, explain: "High-volume breakouts are statistically more reliable, not less." },
      { label: "The trend is ending", correct: false, explain: "Reversals usually need a divergence, not a breakout." },

      { label: "Single-asset blow-up risk", correct: true, explain: "Spreads exposure so one bad position can't sink your account." },
      { label: "All market crashes", correct: false, explain: "In a broad crash, most assets fall together — diversification helps but isn't bulletproof." },

    id: 7, prompt: "What's 'slippage'?",
    options: [
      { label: "Difference between expected price and actual fill", correct: true, explain: "Common in fast or thin markets — eats into edge." },
      { label: "A broker fee", correct: false, explain: "Fees are separate — slippage is execution cost." },

      { label: "Even a 40% win rate is profitable with 1:3 R:R", correct: true, explain: "Math beats prediction — asymmetric trades survive losing streaks." },
