          "Paper trading is the practice of simulating trades without using real money. Instead of risking your hard-earned savings, you use virtual currency to buy and sell stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and other financial instruments. The term dates back to a time when aspiring traders would literally write their hypothetical trades on paper to track performance.",
          "Today, paper trading is usually done digitally through simulated platforms. It can help beginners practise order entry, chart reading, record-keeping, and portfolio mechanics without risking real money. It is one practical way to learn how markets work, but it cannot reproduce every part of live trading, especially slippage, liquidity constraints, and the emotions attached to real losses.",
          "On TradeHQ, every user starts with $100,000 in virtual cash. You can trade 149 assets including blue-chip stocks like Apple (AAPL), cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), ETFs like SPY, forex pairs, and commodities like gold. Every trade you make is tracked, giving you a realistic portfolio experience."

There is no universal number of practice weeks or months that guarantees better results. A more useful goal is to practise until you can follow the same written process consistently across a meaningful sample of simulated trades.",

Record hypothetical entries and exits and review gains and losses over a meaningful sample. TradeHQ executes market orders; stop and limit orders are explained conceptually rather than implemented as pending orders.",
          "Paper trading can also be used to practise risk management. You can test position sizing, predefined exit rules, diversification, and the discipline of writing a trading plan before placing an order. Any percentage risk limit should be treated as a practice parameter, not a universal rule."

The most common chart types are line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts. Candlestick charts are the most popular among traders because they show four key data points: open, high, low, and close prices.",

        heading: "What Is a Market Order?",
        paragraphs: [
          "A market order seeks execution at available prices rather than specifying a limit price. Execution and the final price depend on available liquidity, trading halts and other conditions. The displayed quote is not a guaranteed fill, particularly when prices move quickly.",
          "Market orders prioritize seeking execution over a specified price limit. That trade-off can involve substantial uncertainty in the eventual fill. Compare hypothetical outcomes under different liquidity and gap assumptions rather than prescribe one order type for every urgent situation.",
          "Slippage is the difference between an expected price and the actual fill. Its size varies with order size, liquidity and timing; it is not always pennies in a named asset. TradeHQ uses simplified practice market fills and does not reproduce every exchange execution condition."

        heading: "What Is a Limit Order?",
        paragraphs: [
          "A limit order lets you set the exact price at which you want to buy or sell. A buy limit order executes only at your specified price or lower; a sell limit order executes only at your specified price or higher. Unlike market orders, limit orders give you price control but don't guarantee execution.",
          "For example, if Bitcoin is trading at $68,000 and you want to buy at $65,000, you place a buy limit order at $65,000. If the market reaches that level, the order becomes eligible to fill, subject to available liquidity and order priority. If it never reaches $65,000, the order remains open until you cancel it or it expires.",
          "Limit orders can be useful when price control matters more than immediate execution. They are commonly used for planned entries and exits, but the trade-off is that the order may not fill at all, or may fill only partially, if there is not enough matching liquidity."

        heading: "When to Use Each Order Type",
        paragraphs: [
          "A market order and a limit order make different trade-offs between seeking execution and controlling price. For a learning exercise, compare possible fills during a liquid session, a wide spread and a price gap. Neither urgency nor a familiar ticker guarantees a small execution cost.",
          "A limit order specifies a maximum buy price or minimum sell price. Price control does not guarantee any fill or a full fill, even when a chart touches the level. Compare an unfilled order with a partial fill and a completed fill in a written hypothetical example.",
          "TradeHQ currently executes market orders only. Study limit-order mechanics conceptually with a written example; there is no pending limit-order feature to test on SOL or another asset. Simulator fills cannot establish which order type gives better actual execution."

        paragraphs: [
          "Moving averages (MAs) smooth out price data to reveal the underlying trend. The two most common types are the Simple Moving Average (SMA), which gives equal weight to all prices in the period, and the Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which gives more weight to recent prices and reacts faster to changes.",
          "A 50-period average crossing above a 200-period average is called a golden cross; the reverse is a death cross. The period might mean days or another chart interval. These lagging observations describe the selected series and do not establish that a rally or decline will follow.",
          "Shorter averages such as a 9-period or 21-period EMA react differently from longer averages. A price above an average describes its position relative to that calculation, not a guaranteed trend. TradeHQ chart controls include moving-average and volume overlays; indicator examples should match the actual chart features."

        paragraphs: [
          "The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of price changes on a scale of 0 to 100. Developed by J. Welles Wilder, RSI compares the average gains and losses over a 14-period window to determine whether an asset is overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30).",
          "Readings above 70 or below 30 are conventional RSI descriptions rather than instructions to sell or buy. An extreme reading can persist. Divergence means price and oscillator observations differ; it does not prove a reversal or make one signal universally most reliable.",
          "Compare hypothetical RSI settings and record what each describes before looking at later prices. A pullback to 40–50 or a bounce to 50–60 is not a universal entry rule. TradeHQ's simplified RSI-style practice value should not be mistaken for a standard RSI calculation on historical provider closes."

        heading: "MACD: Combining Trend and Momentum Signals",
        paragraphs: [
          "The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a versatile indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages — typically the 12-period and 26-period EMAs. The MACD line is the difference between these two EMAs, and the signal line is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. The histogram shows the gap between them.",
          "The classic MACD signal is the crossover: when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it's bullish; when it crosses below, it's bearish. The histogram makes these crossovers easy to spot — bars turning from negative to positive indicate building bullish momentum. MACD works best in trending markets and can generate false signals in sideways conditions.",
          "Combining indicators creates another hypothesis to evaluate, rather than guaranteeing the best results. Define each calculation, interval and decision rule, then compare against a simple baseline with the same costs and sample. TradeHQ does not provide a MACD chart overlay; journal examples are conceptual."
